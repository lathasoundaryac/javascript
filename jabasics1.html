    <h2>Q3 For/In Loop</h2>
    <p>The for in statement loops through the properties of an object:</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      const person = { fname: "latha", lname: "soundarya"};

      let txt = "";
      for (let x in person) {
        // for in loop is used here, it loops through the key and value of the variables
        txt += person[x] + " ";
      }

      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = txt;
    </script>
